I am a second year Master's student in Biostatistics at the [Dalla Lana School of Public Health](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/) (DLSPH), working under the supervision of [Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/pullenayegum/) at The Hospital for Sick Children. My current research interests include longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis and irregularly observed data. I am also working as an RA at the [Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/institutes/centre-for-vaccine-preventable-diseases/) at DLSPH, under the supervision of [Dr. Shaza Fadel](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/fadel-shaza/), on a project examining perception of risk and vaccine uptake for a post-secondary cohort of students. 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Math at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/), where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Dmitry Jakobson](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/jakobson/). I have also worked as a research analyst at [Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades](https://www.dge.gob.pe/portalnuevo/) (CDC-Peru), where I explored statistical modelling and data visualization of the COVID-19 epidemic in Peru. 

Outside of work, you'll find me biking around Toronto, visiting record stores and trying out local craft beers at breweries.
